## Project Description
This hands-on project is used for getting familiar with React. An inspiration came up in a [React course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) created by [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/). Some parts of the project are originally wriiten in course materials. I am very thankful for constructing the course. The course is a good starting point to learn React for everyone.
